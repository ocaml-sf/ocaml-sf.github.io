  <h1 class="md-h1">How to invoice the OCaml Software Foundation</h1>
<p class="md-p">If you are recipient of funding for an action of the OCaml Software
Foundation, our most common process is to handle this as freelance
development: we agree on what you do, an hourly rate and a maximal
budget, you do the work, and from time to time you send us invoices
for the time you have already spent on the action.</p>
<h3 class="md-h3">Invoice recipient</h3>
<p class="md-p">The invoices should be in PDF, sent by email, and formally
addressed to the following entity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="md-p">Fondation partenariale Inria / Fondation OCaml<br>
SIRET: 829 176 098 00012<br>
Domaine de Voluceau<br>
78153 Le Chesnay Cedex<br>
France</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="md-h3">Invoice number</h3>
<p class="md-p">The invoices should have a number different from all the ones you
previously sent to us.</p>
<h3 class="md-h3">Banking information</h3>
<p class="md-p">Please include your banking information in the invoice
itself. (This helps our administrative staff.)</p>
<p class="md-p">The bank account were the money is to be paid needs to have
international banking metadata: an IBAN number for the account, and
a BIC/SWIFT number for the bank.</p>
<p class="md-p">If the banks were you live do not provide IBAN and BIC/SWIFT numbers,
note that there are some private companies (for example TransferWise)
that let you setup online accounts and provide you with such
international-friendly account metadata, for a relatively small fee.</p>
<h3 class="md-h3">Tax information</h3>
<p class="md-p">You should specify in the invoice how much of the price is Value Added Tax (VAT), even if it is zero.</p>
<p class="md-p">The VIES VAT number of the INRIA Foundation (which is hosting the OCaml Software Foundation) is FR 69829176098.</p>
<h2 class="md-h2">Other information</h2>
<h3 class="md-h3">Response/payment delay</h3>
<p class="md-p">Once we have received an invoice, we should confirm it to you. The
invoices are then handled by the administrative staff working for the
INRIA Foundation; we have little control over the process, and the
delays can unfortunately be significant (2 weeks is not uncommon).</p>
<p class="md-p">If you have not received a confirmation from us, feel free to ping
again in a couple days. If the payment has not arrived after 2 weeks,
feel free to ask again, we will check with the administrative staff.</p>
<h3 class="md-h3">How often to send us invoice?</h3>
<p class="md-p">You may send us invoices whenever you wish to, but sending many
invoices can increase the load on our administrative staff. &quot;Not more
than once a month&quot; is a good default. Some of our recipients send
invoices when the project is done, or one invoice at half-point and
one invoice at the end.</p>
<h3 class="md-h3">Legal matters</h3>
<p class="md-p">We are assuming that you can legally receive money for your work for
the OCaml Software Foundation. (In many countries, there are simple
legal setups to do some freelance work, possibly in parallel to your
main job.). If this is a problem for you, please do tell us and
explain what the issue is â€” even though our abilities to help
may be limited.</p>
