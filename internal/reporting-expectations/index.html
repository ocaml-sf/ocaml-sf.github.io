  <p class="md-p">You are funded by the OCaml Software Foundation to realize an
action. What sort of reporting do we expect?</p>
<p class="md-p">This page lists our expectations for typical actions. (We may have
given you different, more specific requirements that make sense for
your action only.)</p>
<h2 class="md-h2">Tracking work</h2>
<p class="md-p">During the action, we encourage you to keep a log of the main work
items you perform, that would be useful for someone else to get
a rough idea of what you have done. This does not need to be as
detailed as an internal time-tracking sheet, but for example if you
submit a PR or send a patch as part of the action, include the name of
the PR/patch and an URL -- if you feel motivated, a few words on
explanation.</p>
<p class="md-p">The idea is that someone curious about your work could get a rough
sense of what was done, with pointers to look into the details if
desired. This will also be useful to you to prepare your reports.</p>
<h2 class="md-h2">Report(s)</h2>
<p class="md-p">We expect a short report (for example, 2 pages) at the end of the
action describing what you did, what worked and what did not
work. This is useful for us to evaluate the action, inform our
sponsors and the community, and take this feedback into account for
future actions.</p>
<p class="md-p">If the action is longer than a couple months, it would be nice to send
some information before the end of the action, for example when you
reach the mid-point of the time/budget allocated for the action. It
could be a report of the nature above, or something shorter with just
a piece of log and a mention of the things you found interesting. Some
fundees send us very short reports every month, and this is also fine.</p>
<h2 class="md-h2">Communication</h2>
<p class="md-p">We share the information you send to us internally, and may typically
share them with our sponsors. On some occasions we may also share them
with the wider community. (We currently do not share financial
information to an external audience, but feel free to do it if you
wish to.)</p>
<p class="md-p">Conversely, when you release some public information about your work
(if you announce something or send a PR), we would of course be happy
if you mentioned that the work, or part of the work, is funded by the
OCaml Software Foundation. Your nice work is our best publicity. This
is <em>optional</em>, not an expectation or requirement: you should do as you
feel comfortable doing.</p>
