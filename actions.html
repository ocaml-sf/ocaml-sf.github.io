        <p>The foundation has invested funding and effort (in particular through the work of Yann Régis-Gianas, teaching representative on the Executive Board) in the Learn-OCaml technical platform for online exercises, which powers the OCaml MOOC and several OCaml courses in university.</p>
        <p>We are interested in supporting other technical platforms that allow teaching OCaml to a wide audience, in a school/academic setting or for self-learning; we would also like to grow an open corpus of teaching and learning material, and support in-boarding actions towards non-OCaml programmers.</p>
        <dl>
        <dt>OCaml MOOC</dt>
        <dd><p>We ran sessions of the OCaml MOOC in 2018-2019 (3k registrants, 200 certificates). We employed a TA to help students on the MOOC forums.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>The <a href="learn-ocaml.md">Learn-OCaml</a> online exercise platform</dt>
        <dd><p>The Learn-OCaml exercise platform is open-source and easy for anyone to deploy locally to support their OCaml courses.</p>
        </dd>
        <dd><p>We relicensed the codebase to MIT, and funded further development of the platform by OCamlPro. We employed two interns to write documentation for teachers (platform, exercise-writing…) and review pedagogical material.</p>
        </dd>
        <dd><p>We are actively working on an instance server, to make it easier for people to deploy new instances for their courses without having to host one locally – which is fairly easy to do.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>OCaml exercise corpus development</dt>
        <dd><p>We fund teachers to contribute high-quality exercices to a common exercise database for the Learn-OCaml platform. In particular, we received 10 high-quality advanced exercices from François Pottier, and made available 40 exercises from the MOOC.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Building a teacher community</dt>
        <dd><p>We are trying to build a community of OCaml teacher sharing teaching documents. We provided financial support for a CS-teaching conference at the French national level in 2018, and presented our teaching efforts at the OCaml Workshop on the same year.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Helping Learn-OCaml adoption in universities</dt>
        <dd><p>We provided some financial support for new OCaml courses in 2018, at the Paris-Diderot university (France) and McGill University (Canada). You may be interested in the McGill <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~bpientka/papers/learn-ocaml-icfp19">ICFP’2019 experience report</a> on their new course using the <a href="learn-ocaml.md">Learn-OCaml</a> platform.</p>

        <dt>Community events</dt>
        <dd><p>We sponsored video-capture for the Paris OCaml meetup. (If you would like to run a regular meetup in another city, feel free to get in touch!)</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>OCaml Language design and development</dt>
        <dd><p>We funded two <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/">Outreachy</a> internships to improve our testing of the OCaml compiler and language tools, while participating in improving the diversity in the OCaml community.</p>
        </dd>
        <dd><p>We funded a research internship on type inference, to study approaches to keep the type-checker predictable and robust as the language evolves.</p>
